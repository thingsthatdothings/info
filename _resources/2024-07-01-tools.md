# GitHub Student Developer Pack

![Github image ](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/GitHub-Mark-ea2971cee799.png)

If you have a school email account (high school or university), make sure you take advantage of the **free** Github resources like Github Co-Pilot.  If you're taking a comp sci class, this may turn you into a coding wizard.

Sign-up is required.  You have to provide proof that you're a student - submit a picture of your school id card and/or school syllabus. You might get turned down the first time, but keep trying with other student proof options. The sign-up process may take a week or so, but its free, and worth the wait.

Good-luck!
